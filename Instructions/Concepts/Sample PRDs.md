### SAMPLE 2 - from Wendy on the DevDiv team (Copilot Custom Instructions for MyTodoListApp)

```md
## Project Overview

This workspace contains a .NET Aspire solution for a Todo List application, including:

- **MyTodoApi**: Minimal API backend for todo items, using Entity Framework Core and SQLite.  
- **MyNewTodoListApp**: Blazor WebAssembly frontend for managing todo items, consuming the API.  
- **BlazorApp1**: Additional Blazor app (sample or test).  
- **Aspire.AppHost**: Orchestrator for running the solution locally with Aspire.  
- **Aspire.ServiceDefaults**: Shared service configuration for Aspire projects.

## Key Technologies  

- .NET Aspire (for orchestration and service defaults)  
- Blazor WebAssembly (frontend)  
- ASP.NET Core Minimal API (backend)  
- Entity Framework Core with SQLite (data persistence)  

## Main Features  

- CRUD operations for todo items  
- API endpoints for todo management  
- Blazor UI for interacting with todos  
- Local development orchestration with Aspire  

## File/Folder Highlights

- **Aspire.AppHost/**: Aspire orchestration, contains `Program.cs` and `appsettings.json`.  

## Coding/Response Guidelines  

- Prefer .NET 9 idioms and minimal API patterns.  
- Use dependency injection and configuration best practices.  
- For Blazor, use component-based design and leverage `@inject` for services.  
- When suggesting code, reference the relevant project and file.  
- When discussing API endpoints, refer to **MyTodoApi**.  
- When discussing UI, refer to **MyNewTodoListApp**.  
- For orchestration or service config, refer to **Aspire.AppHost** or **Aspire.ServiceDefaults**.

## Example Use Cases
